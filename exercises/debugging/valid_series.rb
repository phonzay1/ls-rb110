=begin
The valid_series? method checks whether a series of numbers is valid. For the
purposes of this exercise, a valid series of numbers must contain exactly three
odd numbers. Additionally, the numbers in the series must sum to 47.

Unfortunately, our last test case is not returning the expected result. Why is that?
--------------------
This is because on line 5 in the ternary expression, the `if` test condition is
`odd_count = 3`, which is variable assignment, not equality comparison. `odd_count = 3`
will always evaluate as true. The ternary expression should instead read `odd_count == 3 ? true : false`.
(Or even simpler, this line could just read `odd_count == 3`, which will itself return
a boolean)
